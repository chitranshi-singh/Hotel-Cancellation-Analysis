# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation

## Introduction

The hotel demand stems from business travellers and leisure tourists who travel frequently. With information on the
hotel bookings, our goal is to predict booking cancellation. With the increase in flexible cancellation policy through
online services, estimating cancellation rates becomes important so that the hotel is not left with spare rooms to sell
at a lower rate.

## Key business questions

<li> How does cancellation vary across different booking sources?
<li> Is cancellation trend seasonal? If so, when does it occur?
<li> Where do most cancellations come from?
<li> Are bookings with longer lead times more likely to result in a cancellation?
<li> What other factors influence high cancellation rates?

## Data overview

The data is the hotel demand dataset
on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand?datasetId=511638&sortBy=voteCount&searchQuery=time+series)
that contains information on two types of hotels, a resort and city hotel. The dataset has 1,19,390 rows and 32
features. Each observation is a hotel booking done by a customer. The dataset includes bookings by customers who would
arrive between 1st July 2015 and 31st August 2017, including information on cancellation status.
